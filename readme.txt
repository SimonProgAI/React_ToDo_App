--OVERVIEW--
This is a todo app for my teenage son in which each task he completes is awarded a (fake) monetary value. 
He can create a profile with his name and his saving objective. The app calculates how much he saved and how much 
he has left to save based on completed tasks.

--USER STORIES--
As a parent of a teenager, I want to update his or her task list and see a clear a visual representation of it.
As a parent of a teenager, I want to see a history of tasks completed.
As a parent of a teenager, I want to assign a deposit value to each task.

--TECHNOLOGIES USED--
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

--IDEAS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS--
1.Completed tasks show at what time they were completed.
2.A list of objectives and their associated saving values are offered to the user (e.g the user can choose Objective 700: sleepover with my friends).
3.Parents can add penalties.
4.User can see his/her history of achieved saving goals.
